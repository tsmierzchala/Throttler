# Throttler

Console application in .NET for simple port listener and data forwarding to destination with built-in data throttling function.
In addition, the application simulates random packet loss.

#### Example: PacketLossProbability = 0.1 = 10%

**EDGE**: approximately 236 kbps

**2G (GPRS)**: approximately 114 kbps

**3G (UMTS)**: From 384 kbps to 2 Mbps (often averaging about 1 Mbps = 1024 kbps)

**4G LTE**: From 5 Mbps to 100 Mbps (often averaging around 20 Mbps = 20480 kbps)

**Ethernet (standard 100BASE-T)**: 100 Mbps = 102400 kbps
